# Nota-POS: A Point of Sale System Built by Restaurant People, For Restaurant People

## The Problem

Over the course of nearly two decades in the restaurant industry, I have worked with many POS systems that feel like they were built by software developers who have never worked a Friday night dinner rush. They're designed to extract maximum revenue from restaurant owners while ignoring the actual pain points of servers, cooks, and managers on the ground. Features are bloated, interfaces are cluttered, and the people using these systems daily were never consulted in the design process.

## The Solution

**Nota-POS** is a restaurant point of sale system built from the ground up by someone with 20 years of industry experience. Every feature solves a real problem. Every interface decision comes from muscle memory built over thousands of shifts. This isn't software built to sell to restaurants: it's software built to actually help them.

## Key Differentiators

**Built by Someone Who's Been There**
- Designed by a former floor manager, server, bartender and kitchen prepper
- Every feature addresses a real operational pain point
- Interface optimized for speed during service, not executive presentations

**Features That Actually Matter**
- **Kitchen Communication Interface**: Direct FoH ↔ BoH communication during service
- **Order Delay Buffer**: 10-second window to catch mistakes before items fire to the kitchen
- **Server Gamification**: Friendly competition tracking to boost sales AND morale
- **Zero Bloat**: Only the features you actually use during service

**For Small Restaurants, Not Enterprise Chains**
- Single-location focused
- Affordable for independent operators
- Simple enough for any staff member to learn in minutes

## Technical Approach

**MVP Scope:**
- Core POS functionality: floor map, orders, items, modifiers
- Clean, fast UI designed for touch screens
- Industry-standard features without unnecessary complexity

## Current Status

**Phase 1 In Progress:**
- Full-stack application with Spring Boot backend
- SQLite3 database with orders and items
- Fully operational POS system that matches industry standards
- Server-Savior feature: delay system on each order to prevent multiple ticket revisions from making it to the kitchen

**Phase 2 Future Features:**
- Kitchen display system integration
- 86'd item tracking and communication
- Server challenges and performance leaderboards
- Real-time sales analytics

**Phase 3 Stretch Goals:**
- Localized hardware for data hosting to prevent any downtime
- Personal knowledge database written in plain langauge for troubleshooting without endless customer service phone calls
- Inventory tracking by analyzing items sold for both FoH and BoH stocking
